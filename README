Fitting In (release 1-next): a platformer with size-changing collectibles.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

This should work wherever Pygame does.  On systems with a sh-compatible shell,
do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2
executable.

    PLAYING

To finish each level, collect each of the...floating squares.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD, space: move and jump
R: reset current level

WASD works in Dvorak, AZERTY and Colemak too.

    LICENSING

Source code is available under the GPL version 3 (included).
